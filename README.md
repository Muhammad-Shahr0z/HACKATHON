Overview:
This hackathon challenges you to build a complete Interactive Resume Builder step-by-step,
divided into five key milestones. Each milestone builds upon the previous one, taking you from a
static resume to a fully dynamic, editable, and shareable online resume. You can work from home,
completing as many milestones as you can within the 24-hour time frame.
Hackathon Structure:
 The hackathon is divided into 5 milestones.
 Each milestone carries 100 points.
 You can submit your progress for each completed milestone.
 Aim to complete as many milestones as possible within the 24-hour limit.
Milestone 1: Static Interactive Resume Builder (100 Points)
Objective:
Build a static resume using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
Requirements:
 Create a static resume with sections like:
o Personal Information (Name, Contact Details, Profile Picture)
o Education
o Skills
o Work Experience
 Use TypeScript to add basic interactivity, such as a button to toggle the visibility of the
"Skills" section or other sections.
Scoring Breakdown:
 HTML Structure and Completeness (40 points):
o Are all sections (Personal Info, Education, Skills, etc.) clearly created using proper
HTML structure?
 CSS Styling and Responsive Design (40 points):
o Does the resume look visually appealing and function well across mobile and
desktop devices?
 Basic TypeScript Functionality (20 points):
o Are there buttons or any interactivity implemented (e.g., show/hide sections)?
3
Milestone 2: Publish on GitHub and Host on Vercel (100 Points)
Objective:
Publish your static resume created in Milestone 1 to GitHub and deploy it live using Vercel.
Requirements:
 Push the project code to a GitHub repository.
 Deploy the project on Vercel so that the resume is publicly accessible.
Scoring Breakdown:
 GitHub Repository Setup and Organization (50 points):
o Is the code properly committed and pushed to a GitHub repository?
o Is the repository well-organized with proper folder structures and file naming
conventions?
 Successful Deployment on Vercel (50 points):
o Is the resume successfully deployed and accessible online via Vercel?
Milestone 3: Dynamic Resume Builder with Form (100 Points)
Objective:
Convert the static resume into a Dynamic Resume Builder where users can fill out a form, and the
resume is generated based on their input.
Requirements:
 Create a form to capture user input for:
o Personal Information (Name, Email, etc.)
o Education
o Work Experience
o Skills
 Use TypeScript to dynamically generate the resume using the data provided through the
form.
Scoring Breakdown:
 Form Design and Validation (40 points):
o Does the form collect all necessary details in a user-friendly manner?
4
o Is validation implemented to ensure that all fields are filled correctly (e.g.,
mandatory fields)?
 Dynamic Resume Generation (40 points):
o Does the form correctly populate the resume with user input?
o Is the resume updated in real-time without refreshing the page?
 User Experience and Functionality (20 points):
o Is the form-to-resume generation smooth and functional?
Milestone 4: Editable Resume (100 Points)
Objective:
Make the generated resume editable after it’s created.
Requirements:
 Implement the ability for users to click on sections of the resume (e.g., Education, Work
Experience) and directly edit them.
 Ensure the changes are reflected immediately without reloading the page.
Scoring Breakdown:
 Editable Functionality Implementation (60 points):
o Is each section of the resume editable (i.e., can users click and modify content)?
o Are changes reflected without requiring a page refresh?
 TypeScript Code Quality and Logic (40 points):
o Is the TypeScript code organized, eƯicient, and error-free?
Milestone 5: Unique Path and Shareable Link (100 Points)
Objective:
Generate a unique URL for each resume based on the user’s username, and allow the resume to be
shared and downloaded.
Requirements:
 When a user creates a resume, generate a unique URL, for example:
username.vercel.app/resume.
 Provide options for users to share their resume via a link and download the resume as a
PDF.

3. Is it okay to work in teams or collaborate with other students?
o No, this is an individual-based hackathon. Each student must complete their
project on their own. Group work or shared projects are not allowed.
4. Can we work on the same project with someone else or share code?
o No, every student must submit their own unique project. Sharing code or working on
the same project with others is not allowed.
5. What if I get stuck during the hackathon?
o You can refer to the Prerequisites and Best Practices document for guidance or
use online resources like MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, or Stack Overflow to
resolve issues. However, avoid copying code directly.
6. Do we need to deploy the project for each milestone?
o Yes, especially for Milestone 2 and beyond. You need to publish your project on
GitHub and deploy it on Vercel to submit a live link for evaluation.
7. What if I’m unable to complete all milestones?
o It’s okay! Focus on completing as many milestones as you can within the time limit.
You’ll still be evaluated based on what you’ve achieved.
8. Is there a specific structure or template to follow for the project?
